The PoC enables real-time registration and authentication of civilians and criminals. Specifically, my frontend refactoring reduced the page loading time from 2 minutes to 10 seconds by utilizing lazy-loading techniques. Additionally, one of the tightly coupled controllers was divided into five separate endpoints. This restructuring allowed for the complete elimination of other controllers that implicitly used the same logic as these endpoints. This refactoring significantly improved the Developer Experience (DX).",
